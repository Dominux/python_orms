# Tortoise ORM

[Docs](https://tortoise-orm.readthedocs.io/)

Took [an example from the tutorial](https://tortoise-orm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/fastapi.html) and replaced some stuff, for example:

1. Shitty routers (seems like Tortoise ORM devs are good in the ORM creation only)
2. Continuing previous point, they are also bad at testing and using [asyncio](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html), so they just made some stupid examples how to run not-async tests. Pathetic devs...
